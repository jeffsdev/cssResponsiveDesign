# CSS Responsive Design
#### Week 2 - CSS code review for Epicodus  
##### By Jeff Seymour

## Description
###### This is a small web site for the 2st week code review for the CSS course at Epicodus.  
Create a responsive webpage that is similar to Andersson-Wise.  

It must be fluid and have breakpoints at three different screen sizes.  

It does not need to be pixel-perfect, nor does it need to use the same styling techniques as the example. Prioritize responsiveness and structure.  

It does not need to incorporate the same assets (e.g. images, fonts).  

DO NOT USE ANY FRAMEWORKS OR GRID SYSTEMS!. Create your own breakpoints!  

## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS
